# Sentiment Analysis with Hugging Face

Introduction

This project is a basic sentiment analysis using a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The goal is to analyze the sentiment of Yelp reviews.

Project Details

1. Objective: 
   - Use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to classify the sentiment of reviews from the Yelp Reviews Dataset.

2. Steps Completed:
   - Loaded the Yelp Reviews Dataset.
   - Tested the sentiment analysis model on a sample of reviews.
   - Saved the results in a text file.

Installation

To run this project, we need to install the following Python libraries:

pip install transformers
pip install datasets
